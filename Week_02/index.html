        <h1>BoxingforBruins</h1>
        <p>In this map, I aim to create a map of boxing gyms that I have interacted with as a San Fernando resident and incoming UCLA PhD student. These gyms are all in a short distance from one another.</p>
    <h2>San Fernando Gyms</h2>
        <p>As a mapmaker, I aim to identify and assess access to healthy community outlets for 
            classed and racialized communities. I am particularly interested in boxing gyms 
            as an outlet for Latino men in the community. I take a critical mindset as a person who's 
            also been immersed and actively engaged in these settings.
